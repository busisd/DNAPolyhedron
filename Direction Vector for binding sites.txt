each binding site comes with a direction vector
and they are on an edge, which has a perpendicular direction vector

so, when joining polyhedron B to poly A:
 - find a rotation that makes the direction vector of site B = negative direction vector of site A
 - find a rotation that makes the edge direction of site B = edge direction of site A + protein twist (180degree problem?)
   - above two rotations can be combined into a single system of equations?
 - apply these to B
 - apply a translation to B that moves site B to (protein length)*(direction vector of A)/(magnitude A direction vector)+(Site A coords)


#NEXT UP:
#EVERY NEW TETRA CREATED, MAKE A NEW LIST AND PASS IT THAT HAS THE TETRA'S CENTROID AND MAXDISTANCE
#CALCULATE MAXDISTANCE FOR EACH TETRA FIRST, BUT CENTROID AS IT IS CREATED
#THEN USE THOSE TO COMPARE TO OTHER TETRAS THAT EXIST
#FOR COLLISIONS WITH CONNECTORS, CHECK COLLISION OF LINE WITH REGION
#ACTUALLY, DO:
#CLOSEST DISTANCE FROM CENTROID TO LINE SEGMENT (FIND CLOSEST TO LINE AND TO BOTH ENDPOINTS,
#THEN MIN THOSE)
#IF THAT IS LESS THAN THE POLY'S DISTANCE IT INTERSECTS.
