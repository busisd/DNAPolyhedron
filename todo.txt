I'll probably make this program easier to use soon by adding prompts like:
  "What would you like to do?
    1. Create a polyhedron
    2. Load a polyhedron
    3. Create a connector type 
    4. Load a connector type 
    5. Iterate a network"

And then more prompts for each of those [e.g. "Next vertex (or 'done'): "]
